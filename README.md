## Inspiration
Most available platforms for learning are heavy duty and rely on fast internet connections or always-on connectivity. For people that need to be moving and away from internet connectivity this will not be helpful.
## What it does
lernate loko (Esperanto for learning platform) we provides a platform that needs to be accessed once and allows for all learning content to be downloaded for local viewing. We also empower the learner and content providers by allowing full communication via a rich comments system. Additionally we provide a Q & A section to the platform for learners to demand what type of content they wish to be added and exchange ideas with other learners and the content providers. The platform it self is developed using lightweight technologies for ease of access under limited data availability constraints. However the platform is by no means limited, it has fully customizable user management (and user groups. The Q & A system is also very powerful and provides gamification options for answering questions and highly refined control of the postings on the website. 
## How I built it
Being a team of one, I had to rely on as many pre-built open source packages as I could: UserSpice for user management, the powerful commenting system of Commentincs, rich text editing for content creation by tinyMCE and the brilliant Q & A platform by questions2anwers. This also gives the flexibility of each package to be configured for multiple languages and the immense support of their respective dev teams.

## Challenges I ran into
Too many features to add, too little time
## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
Bringing all pieces together cohesively. I have never used any of the underlying subsystems except for 'regular' PHP and MySQL.
## What I learned
How to incorporate the previously mentioned packages together into a useful product. 
## What's next for lernante loko
Adding more features hopefully!
